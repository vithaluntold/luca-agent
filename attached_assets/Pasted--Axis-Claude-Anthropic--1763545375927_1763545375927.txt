| Broad architecture | Transformer-based large LLM family with strong emphasis on long-context and alignment-first design.                                                                                                  | Multimodal Transformer family (Ultra / Pro / Nano) engineered for multimodal + tool use; focused on agentic capabilities. | Foundation model family (LLaMA 3.x) with dense transformers; emphasis on open research releases and scale variants.                                       |
| Multimodality      | Text-first with growing multimodal/tool ecosystem and agentic features (Skills, Research).                                                                                                           | Multimodal by design (text, image, audio, video); DeepMind reports give multimodal engineering details.                   | Primarily text + code; multimodal capabilities added in later releases; open-source flavors for experimentation.                                          |
| Openness           | Commercial API + managed enterprise; not open-source.                                                                                                                                                | Commercial (Google Cloud / Vertex AI) with tight integration into Google services.                                        | Much more open: pretrained & instruction-tuned checkpoints, widely available for local / cloud use.                                                       |
| Long-context       | Very large context windows (200K tokens standard on many Claude models; enterprise/preview options for larger windows). ([Claude Docs][1])                                                           | Large context support in higher-tier models; engineered for tool/agent workflows. ([blog.google][2])                      | LLaMA 3 variants support long contexts (paper reports very large windows up to 128K tokens for big variants). ([arXiv][3])                                |
| Alignment / safety | Alignment-first company; heavy investment in safety layers, instruction/fine-tuning, and enterprise guardrails. Anthropic also builds agent/skill orchestration (Research, Skills). ([Anthropic][4]) | Google applies reward models, safety filters, and tool-use restrictions; integrates with Google safety infra.             | Community + Meta research: safety tools, but greater flexibility for developers (with responsibility on the integrator). ([Meta AI][5])                   |
| Typical strengths  | Long-context reasoning, enterprise features, conservative defaults for safety and compliance. ([Anthropic][6])                                                                                       | Multimodal tasks, large-scale tool use, strong integration with Google ecosystem & agentic flows. ([blog.google][2])      | Cost-efficient scaling, local deployment possibilities, research transparency, and strong coding/benchmarks in instruction-tuned variants. ([Meta AI][5]) |
