## Pricing Psychology & Tactics

### 1. Anchoring Strategy
**Headline:** "Replace $300/hour CPA consultations with $49/month unlimited AI expert"

**Comparison Table:**
```
Traditional CPA:
- $300/hour
- Limited availability
- Single jurisdiction expertise

Luca Professional:
- $49/month (just $1.60/day)
- 24/7 availability  
- Global jurisdiction coverage
- Unlimited questions
```

**Perceived Value:** $300 hour × 8 questions/month = $2,400 value for $49

---

### 2. Decoy Pricing
**Display Tiers Side-by-Side:**

| FREE | PAY-AS-YOU-GO | PLUS | PROFESSIONAL ⭐ | ENTERPRISE |
|------|---------------|------|----------------|------------|
